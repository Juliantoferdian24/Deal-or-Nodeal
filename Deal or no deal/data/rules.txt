									Deal or No Deal rules!


			- The show starts with 20 identical sealed boxes
			- There are 19 boxes on the wings each containing an amount of money between 1p and 1000K $.
			- At the start of the game the player selects a numbered box at random.
			- The player aim is to sell that box back to The Banker for the most amount of money possible
			- The independent adjudicator loads and seals all the boxes. No one but the independent adjudicator knows what is in the boxes.
			- In the first round the player must choose five boxes before the first offer from The Banker
			  The Banker places his opening offer into the capsule, which gets sent to Noel in the loot shoot
			  If the player successfully predicts the opening offer (within 10%) they gain a one-time use of the Offer Button,
			  which can be pressed at any time during the game. When pushed, The Banker must immediately call to make an offer.
			- Noel asks, Deal or No Deal? The player must answer, Deal to accept the offer or No Deal to decline the offer and carry on.
			- Three boxes are opened in the second, third, fourth and fifth rounds, followed by the question from Noel
			- If you decide to No Deal you will continue in this fashion until only two boxes remain.
			- If you accept an offer by saying Deal, the game is still played out in exactly the same way,
			  in order for the player to see what they could have won if they’d carried on.
